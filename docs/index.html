1. learn Jenkins
    java -jar jenkins.war
    init jenkins, user.password
    create pipelinefile to own github repo
    create jenkins_test with example code
    mv jenkinsFile
    mv jenkinsFile /jenkinsFile
2. Things went bad
    Docker failed to start
    - someting related to virtual hdd
      - mainly Hyper-V feature
      - [from Google, SO]
        - cause Windows permission issue
          - solve change folder to d: //drive for dev.
        - cause experimental feature
          - solve turn it off
    reset system/host Windows
    Docker came back to life
3. Come back to jenkins
    Jenkins can access to Agent now
    nohup not found
      - add {Git}/bin to Windows's PATH
      - mklink {Git}/usr/bin/nohup.exe {Git}/bin/nohup.exe
        //with others essential dll
      - don't forget to reset Jenkins (since powershell/cmd does not refresh PATH automatically)
    set Jenkins shell to win32/cmd
      - seems didn't work
4. Install Jenkins as Windows service
    requires new init, no problem
